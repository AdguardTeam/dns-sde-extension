        This extension demonstrates how Structured DNS errors can work if supported natively by browsers.
    </p>

    <p>
        You should first configure your browser to use AdGuard DNS:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Open Security settings in a new tab: <b>chrome://settings/security</b></li>
        <li>Enable <b>Use secure DNS</b></li>
        <li>In <b>Select DNS provider</b> choose <b>Add custom DNS service provider</b></li>
        <li>Enter <b>https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query</b></li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Now every time you try to open a website blocked by AdGuard DNS, the extension will detect that and show you a page indicating that the page was blocked by DNS.

        To see an example try visiting <a href="https://ad.doubleclick.net/" target="_blank">ad.doubleclick.net</a>.
